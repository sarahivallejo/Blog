   <h1>Lazy Loading React Components (with react.lazy and suspense)</h1>

   <p>Sometime last year, the team at React released the version 16.6.0 which shipped with a shiny new feature that would simplify the way we handle lazy loading without the help of third-party libraries.</p>

    <p>Let’s take a look at how you can leverage this feature in your application in order to improve performance and build a better experience for users.

        As always, when building with components it’s useful to organize them in a collection  <a href="https://github.com/teambit/bit">using tools like Bit.</a> Then you can share and use your components in any app you’d like, to speed development and keep your code DRY. Here it is:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <a href="https://bit.dev/">
                <h4>Component y sabe que mas de bit</h4> <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Sapiente consequatur, nobis repudiandae quo id recusandae cupiditate in quia quaerat minima. Eos sunt numquam odio molestiae necessitatibus minima dolorem dolores quam.</p>

            </a>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>What is React.lazy()</h2>
        <p>It is a new function in react that lets you load react components lazily through code splitting without help from any additional libraries. Lazy loading is the technique of rendering only-needed or critical user interface items first, then quietly unrolling the non-critical items later. It is now fully integrated into core react library itself. We formerly used react-loadable to achieve this but now we have react.lazy() in react core.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Suspense</h2>
        <p>Suspense is a component required by the lazy function basically used to wrap lazy components. Multiple lazy components can be wrapped with the suspense component. It takes a fallback property that accepts the react elements you want to render as the lazy component is being loaded.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why is Lazy Loading (& Suspense) Important</h2>
        <p>Firstly, <mark>bundling involves aligning our code components</mark> in progression and putting them in one javascript chunk that it passes to the browser; but as our application grows, we notice that bundle gets very cumbersome in size. This can quickly make using your application very hard and especially slow. With Code splitting, the bundle can be split to smaller chunks where the most important chunk can be loaded first and then every other secondary one lazily loaded. <br>
        <br> 
        Also, while building applications we know that as a best practise consideration should be made for users using mobile internet data and others with really slow internet connections. We the developers should always be able to control the user experience even during a suspense period when resources are being loaded to the DOM.</p>
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>According to the react official documentation, you have webpack bundling already configured for use out of the box if you use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CRA (create react app)</li>
            <li>Next js</li>
            <li>Gatsby</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are not, you will need to setup bundling yourself. For example, see the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/">Installation</a> and <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/">Getting Started</a> guides on the Webpack official documentation.</p>
